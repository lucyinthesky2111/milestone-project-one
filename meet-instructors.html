                     <p>Jerry’s impressive career history in the automotive industry spans over 4 decades. Jerry’s interest in cars began when he was a young boy,
                         helping his father restore classic cars in their back garden. During his time in the motor trade, Jerry has worked his way up from 
                         technician to owning his own garage. He is also an experienced MOT tester, having carried out thousands of vehicle inspections 
                         since the 1990s. 
                         <br>
                        In his spare time, Jerry is kept busy by his 2 grandchildren, watching the rugby and competing in the weekly pub quiz.</p>

                     <p>Aaron has worked in the motor industry for over 20 years. His mum recalls that she knew Aaron was destined to be a mechanic when as a
                        child, he was more interested in trying to break his toy cars and put them back together than racing them around the track! Aaron 
                        began his career as an apprentice vehicle technician as a local garage, before working for numerous leading vehicle manufacturers 
                        including Ford, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz. 
                        <br>
                        Outside of work, Aaron enjoys spending time with his wife and children, long walks with his two dogs and indulging in his passion for photography.</p>

                     <h2>Becky Ludlington</h2>
                     <p>Becky is a former student of Clutch Kings College. She enrolled with us aged 16 after ‘being
                         obsessed with cars’ all her life.
                         After graduating, Becky worked full time as a mechanic for 5 years, including 2 years spent
                         working for Audi. Now Becky splits
                         her working life between being an instructor at Clutch Kings College and continuing with her
                         mechanic role.
                         <br>
                         Becky’s love of cars extends outside of the workshop. In her free time, she loves motorsport
                         racing, a hobby which has taken her
                         to events in many countries including Italy, Germany, France, Austria and Japan. When she isn’t
                         racing around the world, Becky enjoys
                         going to the cinema and playing video games. </p>
