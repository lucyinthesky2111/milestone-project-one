# Introduction
* Clutch Kings College is a fictional training provider for the automotive industry. This site focuses specifically on marketing and gathering sign-ups for their Basic Car Maintenance Course. 

* This is my first milestone project for the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

# Live Site 
[The live site can be viewed here](https://lucyinthesky2111.github.io/milestone-project-one/)

# Repository
[The project repository can be viewed here](https://github.com/lucyinthesky2111/milestone-project-one)

# User Experience
  ## Strategy
  ### Site Owner Goals
  * To market their basic car maintenance course. 
  * To attract a wider range of participants through having an online presence.
  * To receive queries about the course from prospective students. 
  * To increase sign-ups for the course.  

  ### Site Manager Goals
  * For the HTML and CSS code to be clear, logical and contain explanatory comments in order to ensure the site is easy to update and maintain. 
  * For images to be downloaded to site manager's computer, not hosted by an external site to ensure images are always available for the user.  

  ### User Stories
  These can be found in my GitHub [project board](https://github.com/users/lucyinthesky2111/projects/7) for this repository.

  ### User Goals

  * To find contact details for the course provider through a variety of different contact methods. (user story 3).
  * To see the course provider’s location on an embedded map. (user story 4). 
  * To be able to apply for the course quickly and easily online. (user story 5). 
  * To receive acknowledgment that their online application has been received, to include feedback on when they can expect a response. (user story 5).

* For any external links to open in a new tab. 
* To find a navigation menu at the top of every page. 
* To find a footer at the bottom of every page. 
* To receive a custom 404 error page which links back to the Homepage, when trying to access an incorrect URL within the site.

# Skeleton
## Layout
### Information Architecure
* The website consists of a Homepage and 3 further pages: - Course Information, About, Our Instructors and Apply and Contact.  
* Homepage – landing page with brief descriptions of, and links to, the other pages.  
* Course Information –  divided into 2 sections – Course Overview and Course Summary. Course Overview consists of images and corresponding captions for the 8 maintenance tasks taught on the course. Course Summary sets out crucial information about the course in an easy-to-read table.  
* About –  divided into 2 sections – About Us and About You. About Us consists of text explaining the history of the college and about you describes the target participants for the course.  
* Our Instructors – provides a photo and profile of each of the 5 instructors.
* Apply and Contact* - divided into 3 sections – Apply Here, Find Us and Contact Us.  Apply Here provides a course application form for the user to complete, Find Us provides an embedded Google map showing the College’s location and Contact Us provides the address, email address and phone number for Clutch Kings College. *Apply and Contact share a page as I felt that there was not enough content here to justify splitting them into two pages. Having two pages would unnecessarily increase the amount of clicks the user would have to make to find each page.
