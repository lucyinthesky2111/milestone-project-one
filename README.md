# User Experience
  ## Strategy
  ### Site Owner Goals
  * To market their basic car maintenance course. 
  * To attract a wider range of participants through having an online presence.
  * To receive queries about the course from prospective students. 
  * To increase sign-ups for the course.  

  ### Site Manager Goals
  * For the HTML and CSS code to be clear, logical and contain explanatory comments in order to ensure the site is easy to update and maintain. 
  * For images to be downloaded to site manager's computer, not hosted by an external site to ensure images are always available for the user.  

  ### User Stories
  These can be found in my GitHub [project board](https://github.com/users/lucyinthesky2111/projects/7) for this repository.

  ### User Goals
  ### Must Have
  * To find pertinent details about the course (i.e. when and where it is run, how much it costs and what the entry requirements are) to ascertain whether there are any barriers to attending the course (user story 2).
  * To find a breakdown of the course contents in order to assess whether it meets their needs and requirements. (user story 2).
  * To find contact detailers for the course provider through a variety of different contact methods. (user story 3).
  * To see the course provider’s location on an embedded map. (user story 4). 
  * To be able to apply for the course quickly and easily online. (user story 5). 
  * To receive acknowledgment that their online application has been received, to include feedback on when they can expect a response. (user story 5).

  ### Should Have

### User Expectations and Requirements
* (all user story 1) (must-have) 
* To find the website easy to access and navigate on any screen size. 
* For the site to be fully accessible. 
* For the site to be engaging and visually appealing, including high quality images with succinct but adequate descriptions. 
* For any external links to open in a new tab. 
* To find a navigation menu at the top of every page. 
* To find a footer at the bottom of every page. 
* To receive a custom 404 error page which links back to the Homepage, when trying to access an incorrect URL within the site.
